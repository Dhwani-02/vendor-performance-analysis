## üìÅ Project Files

- **`Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`**  
  Combines purchase, sales, and inventory data to produce a vendor-level performance summary.

- **`Vendor Performance Analysis.ipynb`**  
  Performs detailed statistical and visual analysis of vendor profitability, cost margins, and freight expenses.

- **`inventory.db`** *(Required)*  
  Local SQLite database containing normalized data on purchases, sales, inventory, and vendor invoices.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Evaluate vendor profitability and freight efficiency.
- Analyze selling price vs purchase cost to optimize margins.
- Identify brands that need promotional or pricing adjustments‚Äîthose with lower sales but higher profit margins.
